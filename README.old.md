\pard\sa200\sl276\slmult1\f0\fs22\lang9 This is a React application that uses the Airtable API to manage a todo list. Here's a brief overview of the code:\par
\par
The App function is the main component of the application. It uses several hooks to manage state and side effects.\par
\par
The useState hook is used to manage the state of the todo list (todoList), the loading state (isLoading), and the dark mode toggle (isDarkMode).\par
\par
The useCallback hook is used to define functions that fetch, update, and delete todos from the Airtable API. These functions are wrapped in useCallback to prevent unnecessary re-renders.\par
\par
The useEffect hook is used to fetch the todo list from the Airtable API when the component mounts.\par
\par
The BrowserRouter, Routes, and Route components from react-router-dom are used to manage routing in the application.\par
\par
The AddTodoForm, TodoList, Toggle, TodoContainer, and P5Wrapper components are used to build the UI of the application.\par
\par
The AirtableUrl constant is used to store the base URL of the Airtable API.\par
\par
The handleToggleChange function is used to toggle the dark mode state.\par
\par
The fetchData, addTodo, updateData, and deleteTodo functions are used to interact with the Airtable API.\par
\par
The return statement renders the UI of the application. It uses conditional rendering to display a loading message while the todo list is being fetched. It also uses the react-router-dom components to manage routing.\par
